Probably just for my university assignment (wordle and traffic light game).

#### Wordle

There is a twenty word-long list of which one is randomly picked for the game. The user has six attempts to guess the correct word.
An uppercase letter means that the letter is in the right spot, a lowercase character means that it is in the word but not in the right spot, and an asterisk means that it is not present in the word at all.

#### Lights Game

This code is designed to work for the Odd Configuration, shown below:

To play the game, a user presses the Green Button, then waits for the Yellow LED to blink and presses the Orange Button once to try to raise the barrier. The user has multiple tries, until they win or press the Red Button to end the game.
The game is won by the user who manages to raise the barrier 3 times. At this point, all the displayâ€™s LEDs will blink in acknowledgement for 3 seconds at a rate of 2 Hz, then the whole game resets.
