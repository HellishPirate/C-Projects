# C-Projects
Probably just for my university assignment (wordle and traffic light game).
Includes a basic wordle game at the moment. There is a twenty word-long list of which one is randomly picked for the game. The user has six attempts to guess the correct word.
An uppercase letter means that the letter is in the right spot, a lowercase character means that it is in the word but not in the right spot, and an asterisk means that 
it is not present in the word at all.
